# Source Encoding with Channel Encoding

Simulation of source encoding with channel encoding. The coding of a source is simulated with channel coding,
that is, information (in this case an image) is sent through an equivalent channel, where it is 
subjected to noise, which generates an error in the transmitted signal that is corrected from different 
techniques using channel coding, all this with the help of the Python software tool
