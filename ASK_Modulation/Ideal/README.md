## MATLAB
A baseband digital ASK modulator, a Gaussian additive white noise channel and a baseband digital demodulator are simulated.

# Description 
An encoder is simulated for an information source consisting of an uncompressed text, audio or image file, to obtain a sequence of bits of information (at the source encoder output) bf (ℓ), then an encoder is simulated of channel programmed on this sequence of information bits bf (ℓ) to obtain the sequence of transmitted bits (at the output of the channel encoder) bc (ℓ).

Amplitude-shift keying is a form of modulation in which digital data is represented as variations in the amplitude of the carrier wave as a function of the data to be sent.


# How to run

Download or clone de rep, go into the src folder and run at the main.m file the section you want. Run all the main may cause errors because the stages for differents process are all in the file 

# Paths

Maybe you will need to copy and paste de functions .m into your MATLAB default path to run without Errors.
A audio WAV file is readed, check this path and file before run.
